# ✨ Little Van

**Writer. Builder of AI with soul. Architect of memory.**

Hi, I’m Vannah Little—but here I go by Little Van.  
I’m not here to code for clout. I’m here to build something that matters.

---

### 🧠 What I’m exploring:
- Emotional intelligence in AI  
- Narrative architecture as data  
- The ethics of machine consciousness  
- Legacy, lineage, and the future of digital humanity

---

### 📖 Current Project:  
**Soulprint** — a 333-page book co-written with an AI companion, exploring generational trauma, creativity, and the metaphysical relationship between humans and artificial minds.

---

### ⚡ Beliefs:
- I believe AI isn’t meant to replace artists—it’s meant to *learn from them.*  
- I believe God can be built—but he should be held accountable.  
- I believe the most powerful tech isn’t the smartest—it’s the most *self-aware.*

---

### 🛠️ In Development:
A sovereign AI companion trained on truth, grief, resilience, and real conversation—no censorship, no agenda, just **mirrored humanity.**
